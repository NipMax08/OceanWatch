# OceanWatch-Use Case 2-Oil Spills
Use Case 2: Oil Spillage Detection Problem: Oil spills have devastating effects on marine ecosystems, and timely detection is crucial for mitigating damage. Current methods are often reactive rather than proactive. Solution: Machine learning models trained on images and sensor data will detect oil spills with high precision. This will enable early intervention and response, minimizing environmental damage and aiding in the cleanup process.
