Projects in Machine Learning-INFO8665 Capstone Project involving three different use cases that all aim to tackle problems related to the ocean
Project: OceanWatch
Overview Marine pollution is a global problem that affects every facet of our lives, from agriculture to industry. This project leverages machine learning technologies to tackle critical environmental issues related to marine pollution

Description

We are focused on creating advanced detection systems that accurately identify marine debris, oil spills, and algal blooms, enabling timely interventions to protect ocean health
Utilizing satellite imagery and sensor data to train machine learning models.
Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis and anomaly detection algorithms will be employed to identify and classify marine pollution incidents
Usecases
Marine Debris Detection
Oil Spills Detection
Algae Bloom Detection
Use Case 1: Marine Debris Detection Problem: Marine debris is a global pollution problem that poses a severe threat to marine life, navigation, and the overall health of the ocean. Traditional methods of detecting debris are labor-intensive and inefficient. Solution: By applying machine learning algorithms to analyze satellite and aerial imagery, we can automate the detection of marine debris. Our model will identify and classify debris types, allowing for quicker and more accurate clean-up operations.

Use Case 2: Oil Spillage Detection Problem: Oil spills have devastating effects on marine ecosystems, and timely detection is crucial for mitigating damage. Current methods are often reactive rather than proactive. Solution: Machine learning models trained on images and sensor data will detect oil spills with high precision. This will enable early intervention and response, minimizing environmental damage and aiding in the cleanup process.

Use Case 3: Algae Bloom Detection Problem: Algae blooms can create dead zones in water bodies, harming aquatic life and affecting water quality. Early detection is essential to manage and mitigate these blooms. Solution: Our machine learning approach will analyze satellite imagery and water quality data to detect and monitor algae blooms. By identifying bloom patterns and predicting their spread, we can help manage and prevent the adverse effects on marine ecosystems.
