# OceanWatch-Use Case 3-Algae Bloom
Use Case 3: Algae Bloom Detection Problem: Algae blooms can create dead zones in water bodies, harming aquatic life and affecting water quality. Early detection is essential to manage and mitigate these blooms. Solution: Our machine learning approach will analyze satellite imagery and water quality data to detect and monitor algae blooms. By identifying bloom patterns and predicting their spread, we can help manage and prevent the adverse effects on marine ecosystems.
