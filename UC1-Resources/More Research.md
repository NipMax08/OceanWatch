#### 1) An application of a deep learning model designed for object detection in the TensorFlow framework for observing marine debris floating on the surface of the ocean. The Data is planet small satellite imagery is utilized in this study. Specifically, the 3-meter imagery product called Planetscope .

#### 3) Marine Debris Archive (MARIDA)
Marine Debris Archive (MARIDA) is a marine debris-oriented dataset on Sentinel-2 satellite images. It also includes various sea features that co-exist. MARIDA is primarily focused on the weakly supervised pixel-level semantic segmentation task. This repository hosts the basic tools for the extraction of spectral signatures as well as the code for the reproduction of the baseline models.
